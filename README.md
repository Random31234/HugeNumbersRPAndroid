# HugeNumbersRPAndroid
The official release of Huge numbers RP Android build


Of note here are the things worth needing to know before you get started. First you must download the apk raw as is. 
Second once you install it, you need to find the apk in your files and then open it up and install the proper app

From there you can enjoy the app and use it accordingly, though of note and more worthy of note is that each sheet has their
own math systems that you can create yourself, distribute from copy paste, and more, though of note future updates may occur
to change some of these which will be informed in a proper update logs sheet.
For android, copying and pasting is slightly more complicated, you may need to use a floating keyboard setting for your android keyboard itself, and more relevant the text editing feature, this will allow you to copy and paste from android
